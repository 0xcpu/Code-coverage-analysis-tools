    ARCHIVE CONTENTS
    
./Coverager.dll - PIN instrumentation module for code coverage analysis.
./coverage_test.exe - Test application to buid code coverage map for Internet Explorer process.
./coverage_parse.py - Program for parsing the logs, that has been generated by instrumentation module.
./symlib.pyd - PDB symbols library for Python (see symlib_test.py for usage details).


    USAGE DETAILS
    
1) Download and install PIN toolkit (http://www.pintool.org).

2) Copy Coverager.dll into the PIN toolkit root directory.

3) Edit execute_pin.bat scenario and put PIN toolkit root directory path into the PINPATH variable.

4) Use execute_pin.bat from command line to run some aaplication and generate code coverage map for it. Example:

    > execute_pin.bat C:\Windows\system32\calc.exe
    
5) After the target applicaion termination 4 log files will be created (CoverageData.log, CoverageData.log.modules, CoverageData.log.routines and CoverageData.log.blocks).

6) Use coverage_parse.py program to extract information from the generated logs. Example:

    > python coverage_parse.py Coverager.log --dump-routines --modules "calc" --outfile routines.txt
    
For detailed information about coverage_parse.py usage see comments into the Python source.
